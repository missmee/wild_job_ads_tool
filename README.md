# wild_job_ads_tool

Building a job ads tool concatanating ads from different online sources for data analysts in France with a LLM option + a dashboard

Team job.

I ran a Python script to get new ads from Welcome to the Jungle API for "data analyst". To do so I used a Chrome driver and Selenium.  

I also built the script to interact with our database using FAISS, Langchain and the LLM Llama3.
